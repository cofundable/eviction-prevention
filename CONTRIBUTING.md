## How Can I Contribute?

### Report a bug

If you think you have found a bug in this tool, we'd love your help identifying and fixing it. To do so, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Search the issue list:** Check to see if anyone has reported a similar issue. If so, comment on that issue with additional details or context.
2. **Use the issue template** If no one else has reported it yet, please submit a new issue and select the [bug report template](https://github.com/cofundable/evicition-prevention/issues/new?template=1-bug-report.yml).
3. **Check the Bug Tracker:** Check the status of your bug by referencing the Bug Tracker project board on the project tab.

### Request new functionality

If you don't have specific language or code to submit but would like to suggest a change, request a feature,
or have something addressed, we'd love to get your feedback. To request new functionality, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Search the issue list:** Check the list of existing issues to see if anyone has requested a similar feature or functionality. If so, feel free to comment on that issue with more context or details.
2. **Use the issue template** If no one else has requested something similar, please submit a new issue and select the [Feature Request](https://github.com/cofundable/evicition-prevention/issues/new?template=2-feature-request.yml) template.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all feature requests will be implemented. The project maintainers will review each feature request and consider scoping it into the roadmap or explain why the feature won't be implemented.

### Contribute to the codebase

If you've implemented a new feature, fixed a bug, or made some documentation clearer, we'd love to consider your contribution to this tool. In order to submit a contribution, please follow these steps:

1. **Fork the repo:** Create a copy of this repo where you can make your proposed changes by [following the Github forking methodology](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart/fork-a-repo).
1. **Find or create an issue:** Before proposing a change, make sure there is a corresponding issue (i.e. Bug Fix, Task, Feature Request) that describes the contribution you'll be making. If there isn't an existing issue, create a new one by selecting and filling out a template from the issue tab.
1. **Create a feature branch:** Create a feature branch on your forked repository with a descriptive name, ideally one that references the issue number that your contribution is related to (e.g., `issue-10-unit-testing`).
1. **Make changes and test them:** Add your code or documentation and commit those changes to the feature branch. If your contribution includes code, make sure you've written tests for it and that all of the tests are passing.
1. **Submit a pull request** When you're ready to make your contribution, [submit a pull request against the upstream repo.](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) and fill out the PR template sections so that project maintainers can begin to review your contributions.
1. **Fix requested changes:** As maintainers review your proposed contribution, they may request specific changes. If so, simply add and commit those changes to the feature branch directly and they'll automatically show up on the PR.
1. **Celebrate:** Once all of the requested changes are made, your commits will be merged into the `main` branch. Time to give yourself a hand because you just added to this project!!!
